Code Dashboard
==============

Code Dashboard claims to be a platform to keep track of your changes in your private Git repositories by providing a platform for code-review, commit listing and tagging and will link everything with your bugtracker.

code review is done here in a post-commit way, so your workflow goes on but nothing is deployed unseen later.

Status
======

I started the project just after checking out many code review tool of which none did cover my needs. It is in a very early development state so do not expect anything to work properly
